The history of war teems with occasions where the interception of
dispatches and orders written in plain language has resulted in
defeat and disaster for the force whose intentions thus became known
at once to the enemy. For this reason, prudent generals have used
cipher and code messages from time immemorial. The necessity for
exact expression of ideas practically excludes the use of codes for
military work although it is possible that a special tactical code
might be useful for preparation of tactical orders.

It is necessary therefore to fall back on ciphers for general military
work if secrecy of communication is to be fairly well assured. It
may as well be stated here that no practicable military cipher is
mathematically indecipherable if intercepted; the most that can be
expected is to delay for a longer or shorter time the deciphering of
the message by the interceptor.
